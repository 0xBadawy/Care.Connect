## Abstract

Time is an important factor in many sides of our life. Upon seconds many things can change . Obviously , the medical field is one of the most , if not the most, fields that depends on time as a main factor. For example , in medical operations , patient treatment and emergency medical services .Emergency medical services depend on time with a high percentage . Because it includes delivering the patient into the medical institution (e.g.hospital) to take actions with him. Every second is important, especially with patients who have serious diseases like heart diseases . So, it is a serious problem especially in Egypt .This problem can be solved by **reducing the time** in the stages of the ambulance services process as much as possible . Nowadays new technologies have arisen. We build the solution upon specific design requirements which our solution must achieve to be effective and efficient. Our solution contains **hardware** and **software** that help the paradigmatic and the medical institution to make the time of the ambulance services process to the minimum extent to save the life of the patient . Such as ,preparing the ER **(emergency room)** , make needs for the patient treatment ready and announcing the doctor. After many tests, our solution showed great results and achieved the design requirements very accurately and precisely.

## Hospital Update System

The Hospital Information Synchronization System serves as an integral subsystem designed to synchronize critical data with the central server located within each healthcare facility. Its primary function is to ensure that up-to-date records of available blood supplies and vacant beds are maintained, thereby facilitating efficient resource management and patient care.
